## 🚀 Featured Projects

🎮 **FPGA Ray Tracing Engine**  
I built a hardware ray tracer in **Verilog** on the **Xilinx PYNQ-Z2**, using a modular pipeline (Thread Generator, Ray Core, Sphere Intersector, Shading, Framebuffer) with **Q18.14 fixed-point math**. By combining **parallel square root units** with **sequential stages** and tight **FIFO synchronization**, I achieved a **5× speedup**; validated the design with **testbenches**, **Vivado ILA**, and timing analysis. *(Throughput example: ~5 pixels / 44 cycles @ 25 MHz ≈ ~10 fps at 640×480.)*

🔀 **Custom VLSI 4×1 Multiplexer (45 nm)**  
A full-custom, transistor-level 4×1 MUX with enable in **Cadence Virtuoso** (**GPDK45**). I contributed across the flow and **led the final layout**, completing **ERC/DRC/LVS**, **parasitic extraction**, and timing sims to confirm correctness and symmetry. The project showcases a clean schematic-to-layout methodology and disciplined verification.

🏠 **Voice Recognition System (VGGVox, pretrained)**  
Implemented a **Python** voice verification pipeline focused on **signal preprocessing**—pre-emphasis, framing, FFT, normalization with **NumPy**—and **adapted the data shape** to a **pretrained VGGVox** model with imported weights for embedding-based speaker verification (cosine distance). Intended for future smart-home integration.

📈 **Java 3D DBSCAN Clustering**
Implemented **DBSCAN** in Java to cluster 3D point clouds from CSV using `eps` and `minPts`, labeling noise and assigning random RGB colors per cluster. Includes neighbor search, cluster-size reporting, and CSV export with coordinates, labels, and colors.

⚙️ **Inductance Solver and Plotter (C Project)**  
Built a C program to compute inductance **L versus pc** using the **bisection method**, with structured file I/O and binary data handling. Plotted results using **PLplot**, applying numerical methods and scientific visualization.

📱 **Service Novigrad (SEG2505 Android App)**  
A course group project simulating public-service workflows: account creation, branch search, service requests, ratings, and status notifications. Built with **Android Studio** and **Firebase** (real-time sync); we modeled the system with **UML class diagrams** and iterated through incremental deliverables to ship a functional prototype.
