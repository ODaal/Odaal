## Featured Projects

**FPGA Ray Tracing Engine**  
I built a hardware ray tracer in **Verilog** on the **Xilinx PYNQ-Z2**, using a modular pipeline (Thread Generator, Ray Core, Sphere Intersector, Shading, Framebuffer) with **Q18.14 fixed-point math**. By combining **parallel square root units** with **sequential stages** and tight **FIFO synchronization**, I achieved a **5× speedup**; validated the design with **testbenches**, **Vivado ILA**, and timing analysis. *(Throughput example: ~5 pixels / 44 cycles @ 25 MHz ≈ ~10 fps at 640×480.)*

**Custom VLSI 4×1 Multiplexer (45 nm)**  
A full-custom, transistor-level 4×1 MUX with enable in **Cadence Virtuoso** (**GPDK45**). I contributed across the flow and **led the final layout**, completing **ERC/DRC/LVS**, **parasitic extraction**, and timing sims to confirm correctness and symmetry. The project showcases a clean schematic-to-layout methodology and disciplined verification.

**Optimal Speed Control of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)**  
This repository contains a complete comparative study of classical and modern control strategies for Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) speed regulation through throttle adjustment.

**Wideband Anti-Reflective Coating Optimization for Solar Cells**  
This repository presents a complete analytical and numerical study on the design of 2-layer and 3-layer anti-reflective (AR) coatings using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). The work evaluates reflectivity, transmissivity, and solar power production across the 400–1400 nm spectrum, identifying optimal refractive index configurations that maximize energy transmission into photovoltaic cells.

**Voice Recognition System (VGGVox, pretrained)**  
Implemented a **Python** voice verification pipeline focused on **signal preprocessing**, pre-emphasis, framing, FFT, normalization with **NumPy** + adapted the data shape to a **pretrained VGGVox** model with imported weights for embedding-based speaker verification (cosine distance). Intended for future smart-home integration.

**Java 3D DBSCAN Clustering**
Implemented **DBSCAN** in Java to cluster 3D point clouds from CSV using `eps` and `minPts`, labeling noise and assigning random RGB colors per cluster. Includes neighbor search, cluster-size reporting, and CSV export with coordinates, labels, and colors.

**Inductance Solver and Plotter (C Project)**  
Built a C program to compute inductance **L versus pc** using the **bisection method**, with structured file I/O and binary data handling. Plotted results using **PLplot**, applying numerical methods and scientific visualization.

**Service Novigrad (SEG2505 Android App)**  
A course group project simulating public-service workflows: account creation, branch search, service requests, ratings, and status notifications. Built with **Android Studio** and **Firebase** (real-time sync); we modeled the system with **UML class diagrams** and iterated through incremental deliverables to ship a functional prototype.
